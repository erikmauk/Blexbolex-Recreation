# Blexbolex-Recreation (Computational Art: Lab 2)
In this lab, I used a reference image of the French artist Blexbolex's piece "Escape" and recreated it using JavaScript.

My work was later combined with one of my classmates, Victoria Rund's work 
which was another recreation of a different Blexbolex piece in one of my projects.
The project (project 1 which is also on my profile) also animates the biker from my piece
and shrinks the man from Victoria's.

Within this repository, you will find a screenshot of the final product attached. Enjoy!
