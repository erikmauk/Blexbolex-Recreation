# Blexbolex-Recreation (Introduction to Computing: Lab 2)
In this lab, I used a reference image of the French artist Blexbolex's piece "Escape" and recreated it using JavaScript.

My work was later combined with one of my classmates, Victoria Rund's work 
which was another recreation of a different Blexbolex piece in one of my projects.
The project (project 1 which is also on my profile) also moves the biker from my piece
and shrinks the man from Victoria's.

To see this JavaScript file for yourself, here is a link to a Cal Poly HTML page where my code is being hosted:

Then, click on "Blexbolex."
